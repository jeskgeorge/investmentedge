                <pFor decades, Fixed Deposits (FDs) have been the preferred savings option for many Indians. They offer safety, assured returns, and peace of mind. While capital protection is important, there is a silent risk that many investors overlook — inflation.</p>
                
                <h2>Why You Need to Look Beyond Fixed Deposits?</h2>
                <p>Inflation steadily reduces the purchasing power of your money. To truly protect and grow your wealth, it is important to look beyond fixed deposits and consider diversified, market-linked investment options.Example If inflation is 6% per year and your FD gives a return of 6% before tax then your real return is almost zero, and after tax, it becomes negative.This means that even though your money appears safe in an FD, its actual value is shrinking.</p>
                
                <div class="insight-box">
                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong>Capital protection is important, but wealth preservation means beating inflation. Fixed deposits alone may not be enough to achieve this. Diversified market-linked investments, when chosen correctly and held for the long term, can help protect your purchasing power and build sustainable wealth.

Before investing, it is always advisable to understand your risk profile and consult a qualified financial professional.</p>

                <p>FDs are suitable for short-term needs and emergency funds, but relying solely on them may not help you achieve long-term financial goals.</p>
